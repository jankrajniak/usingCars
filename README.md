## Description
- This project is used to demonstrate knowledge of building JavaScript code  which executes in the command line
- The user interacts with the application via the command line
- The application is written in TypeScript
- The user is able to create and select multiple types of vehicles (cars, trucks and motorbikes) and interact with those vehicles 
- The interactions include starting and stopping the vehicle, accelerating and decelerating, and turning the vehicles
- The user can also print our details of each vehicle
- Trucks and motorbikes can perform unique actions such as towing other vehicles or popping wheelies respectively
- Logic is built in to check if the vehicles performing those actions are appropriate


## Installation Instructions
- The application requires typescript and inquirer to be installed
- A package.json file is included in the repository. Typing the command npm install in the command line will install all of the required dependencies
- The .ts files are stored in the "src" directory
- The typescript compiler outputs the transpiled files in the "dist" directory


## How to Use the App
- To run the application, type the comman npm run start.
- This will both transpile the typescript code and launch the javascript in the dist folder (via Node.js)
